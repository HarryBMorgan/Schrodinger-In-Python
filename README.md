# Schrodinger-In-Python
Solving the Time Dependent Schrodinger equation in Python using the method of finite differences.

A task for university. Here I used the methods of finite differences to programme a solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation. Data files were output to allow the plot of the 3D equation using GNUPlot. The plot command code is provided also. Notes on the programme have been provided.

Update - This recieved 70% in marking.
